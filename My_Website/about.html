            <p> One of thing I like to do is to solve problems. Every day I would look up some physic problem and tried to solve them. Ske to listen and be taught my the Physic teachers. They makes the subject more enagaing and always have really cool demonstration. Other things that I do for side activities are reading books and watching anime.</p> </p>
